# battleship-rs

A battleship game written in Rust.

## what?

This repo will contain the code for running battleship and playing battleship either through a CLI or the web.

## why?

For fun and to learn a few things:

- General Rust code
- Wasm in Rust
- Use React with Wasm + Rust
- CLI in Rust
- Structuring of Rust projects
- Practice OOP in Rust
- Unit testing in Rust
- Hosting Wasm apps in the cloud

## roadmap

1. A basic implementation of battleship that can be played in the CLI. (on going)
2. A basic implementation of battleship that can be played on the web.
3. Add React + Typescript + Vite on the web.
4. Add multiplayer functions: User Auth, WebSockets, SQL, Redis. (optional)
